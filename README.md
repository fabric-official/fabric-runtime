Fabric Runtime

The Fabric Runtime powers the decentralized execution layer of Fabric 1.0 — Universal AI Fabric.
It is a distributed, policy-enforced, enclave-secured runtime that executes compiled Fabric agents (binaries generated by fabric-lang) across a global network of nodes.

This runtime ensures forensic provenance, royalty enforcement, energy accounting, and quantum coordination for every agent execution.

🌟 Key Features

🖥️ Agent-VM Runtime: Lightweight, high-performance virtual machine implemented in C++
🛡️ Secure Enclaves (SGX): Hardware-backed execution with attestation for trustless verification
🌍 Distributed Scheduling: Supports multi-node execution, load balancing, and agent swarming
⚡ Energy Ledger: Tracks and enforces per-agent energy budgets with recharge capabilities
📜 Policy Enforcement: Ensures compliance (GDPR, HIPAA) and royalty split rules during execution
🔗 Audit-Provenance: Real-time, immutable provenance logging to the Fabric ledger
🌀 Quantum Coordination: Multi-agent quantum entanglement and rollback support (Fabric 1.1)
🛠️ gRPC Services: Remote agent control, telemetry streaming, and runtime introspection

🚀 Core Workflows

1. Running an Agent
fab runtime start --agent compiled-agent.bin
Launches the Agent-VM in SGX enclave mode
Verifies royalty policies and energy budgets
Streams telemetry to the audit ledger
2. Streaming Telemetry
fab runtime monitor --agent <id>
Real-time atomic mutation logs
Energy draw and provenance deltas
3. Distributed Execution
fab runtime deploy --cluster fabric-nodes.yaml
Deploys runtime across a cluster of Fabric-enabled nodes
Enables multi-agent swarm coordination
🛡️ Security and Compliance

✅ Secure Enclaves: Intel SGX-backed runtime integrity
✅ Remote Attestation: Verifiable agent execution state
✅ Royalty & Policy Enforcement: Ensures developers are compensated
✅ Audit-Provenance: Immutable mutation trail for every execution
🧩 Planned Extensions

Fabric 1.1: Quantum entanglement and atomic rollback
Consensus Layer: Decentralized runtime governance and scheduling
Multi-Cloud Execution: Agent portability across cloud providers

Apache 2.0 — Fabric Runtime is free and open-source.
Execution economics are enforced through royalty flows and agent forks.
